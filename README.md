# bridgerv2  
A cool logic game where you skillfully build bridges to win.

## How the Gameplay Works  
The game board consists of piers. Each player, Red and Blue, has 42 piers each.

Green controls the two outermost columns, while Red owns the two outermost rows of the matrix.  
The goal for Green is to connect the top and bottom columns in a straight line using bridges. Red, on the other hand, aims to create a continuous connection between the two outermost rows.  

Bridges can only be placed on the white cells. These bridges are connected to the piers, forming a pathway. When one player's connection is complete, that player wins.  

In theory, it might look something like this (note: some early considerations for AI are included):

Now, let's discuss the game mechanics.  
The challenge lies in developing an algorithm to detect whether a player has won and another algorithm capable of playing on par with a human (while also being time-efficient). Below is a messy compilation of all considerations in a single image:

This can also be represented as a matrix:  
```
- 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 
2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 
- 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 - 
2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 
- 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 - 
2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 
- 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 - 
2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 
- 1 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 - 
2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 
- 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 - 
2 2 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 
- 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 
```  

0 = empty cell / unoccupied field / space for bridges  
1 = Green player  
2 = Red player / AI  
â€“ = theoretically never occupied
